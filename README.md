## Oh Europa

### Introduction
This is the Android component to Action Hero's Oh Europa project. 

Simply put Action Hero would record audio in Europe upload it to a special server which then interfaces with Radio.co.

In the Oh Europa Client Application they would create beacon zones, which the iOS and Android Applications collect.

When participants who have downloaded the application enter the beacon zone they are able to listen to a special radio station that broadcasts the collected audio from Action Hero's Journey.
