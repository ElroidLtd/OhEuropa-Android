	<string name="info_title">OH EUROPA</string>
	<string name="info_body">This compass &amp; map directs you to beacons placed throughout Europe at its edges, junctures &amp; boundaries, transmitting an ever-evolving library of love songs, broadcasting 24/7. These love songs are being collected by Gemma Paintin &amp; James Stenhouse, two British artists who work together under the name Action Hero.\n\nFor 6 months during 2018, they are travelling the length and breadth of Europe, driving over 30,000km from North to South, East to West &amp; everywhere in between. As they travel, they will invite the people they meet to sing for them, inside their motorhome.\n\nWhen you arrive at a beacon, your compass will automatically tune in to the broadcast. Listen with headphones for the best experience. Good luck!</string>
